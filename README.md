# LinQView
Integrate multiple modalities of CITE-seq data for single cell populations identification
Please refer to https://WilsonImmunologyLab.github.io/LinQView/ for installation instruction and tutorial.

\
The primary idea behind LinQ-View for CITE-seq is to calculate the dissimilarity representations for each single cell profiling modality (i.e. mRNA and surface protein expression) and then combine the dissimilarities from each modality. We reason that combining dissimilarity representations may help emphasize different information from each modality to maximally capture and infer cell heterogeneity
